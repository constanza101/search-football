**Analysis**
----
  * **Website content**
  
      * Landing page with a Search bar.
      * Results page with a List of results.

* **How to perform searches:**


There are two imputs. We can type only one team name in one of the inputs, or one team name in EACH one of the inputs, this will bring different types of results: 


  * Two football teams names:
      * List of results:
          * games played
          * results
          * stadium
          * date
          * listed in order by season.    
  * One football team name:
    * List of results:
        * name
